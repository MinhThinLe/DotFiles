# Dotfiles collection

If you wish to install these, first, install its dependencies

```sh
sudo pacman -S git stow
```

Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://MinhThinLe/dotfiles
```

Then execute the install script

```sh
cd dotfiles
./install.sh
```

The install "script" can be a little finicky as it's only a shorthand for
2 stow commands, if any errors were to pop up, please take the time out to
google the problems yourself.
